# Ocaml-WiringPi2
This is a thin binding to [WiringPi](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi) making use of OCamls excellent `ctypes` and `dune`s new features to more easily bind to C-libs with autogenerated build-rules.
The thin bindings are added as needed, which has the advantage that they have been tested in practice. Make a PR if you want to bind to more of the WiringPi interface.
